A translation of the [jekyllxhibit welcome page](https://github.com/colaborativa/jekyllxhibit/blob/gh-pages/_posts/exhibits/2013-03-10-bienvenidos.md):

This is a basic template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an open source project increasingly used as a tool for blogging. With Jekyll you can create your own Web page in static html.

To use this template with Jekyll, click "Fork me in GitHub" and follow the instructions provided in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/colaborativa/jekyllxhibit/blob/gh-pages/README.md) file.

Good luck!
