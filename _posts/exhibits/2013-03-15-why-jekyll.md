A translation of the [jekyllxhibit "Why do I like Jekyll?" page](https://github.com/colaborativa/jekyllxhibit/blob/gh-pages/_posts/exhibits/2013-03-15-porque-jekyll.md):


[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open source project begun in 2008, is a static html web page generator. It is often said that blogging is a tool for hackers but thanks to [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) is available to anyone who wants to use it

Prose.io is a tool specifically designed for editing Jekyll sites, and we can use it to easily and quickly modify our site.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets [GitHub](http://www.github.com) users host free Jekyll sites from their repositories. Any changes we make through Prose.io the content of our website will automatically be published through GitHub Pages on their website.
